# Runnn

Runnn is a master agent designed to handle various tasks autonomously, only pausing when specific input is needed. With one simple setup, you can easily download, install, and start using Runnn.

## Getting Started

To get started with Runnn, simply download the `runnn.bat` file and run it. The script will check if **Ollama** is installed on your system. If Ollama is not installed, it will automatically download and install it.
